### Setup a development environment

- Create the database config file from the sample:

      cp spec/config.example.yml spec/config.yml

- Install the required gems:

      bundle install
      bundle exec appraisal install

- Edit `spec/config.yml` to reflect the configuration of all your database adapters (similar to `database.yml`)

- To run the test suite, do:

      bundle exec rake

- By default, this will only run the tests with the latest version of ActiveRecord and using an in-memory SQLite3 database.
  This is the simplest way to ensure you've not broken anything.

- If you want to run the test suite using a particular database, do:

      bundle exec rake spec:mysql
      bundle exec rake spec:postgresql

- Before committing your changes, ensure they're compatible with all adapters, *and* all ActiveRecord versions by running:

      bundle exec appraisal rake spec:all
